### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Imesh Chamara. I'm 18 y/o (2020) self-taught developer. I do open source because I think it's nice to share knowledge with others.

### Projects
I have made windows apps, tools, websites, web servers, discord bot, telegram bots, etc. I have been code with C, C++, VB, C#, HTML, JavaScript, NodeJS. I have worked with React and made lightweight alternative ic-app. I usually don't care about very old browsers and Internet Explorer when build websites.

Take a good look around.
